Today I completed the implementation of comprehensive deck and card import functionality for MetaForge Pro. This was a significant enhancement that adds the ability to import decks from SWUDB, text lists, JSON, and other formats directly into the application.

Key accomplishments:
- Created SwudbImporter service for handling SWUDB-specific import logic
- Developed CardImporter for general-purpose card imports from multiple formats
- Built DeckImportService for high-level import orchestration with progress tracking
- Enhanced the DeckBuilder UI with an advanced import modal
- Added support for URL, text list, and JSON import methods
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and validation
- Integrated the import functionality with the existing deck saving system

The import system now allows users to:
- Import decks directly from SWUDB URLs
- Paste text lists of cards in various formats
- Import structured JSON data
- Receive real-time feedback during import operations
- Handle errors gracefully with informative messages

All functionality has been tested and integrated into the running application at http://localhost:8080. The implementation follows best practices with TypeScript type safety, modular architecture, and seamless integration with existing features.

This completes the core import functionality requirement, significantly enhancing the user experience for bringing external decks into MetaForge Pro.
