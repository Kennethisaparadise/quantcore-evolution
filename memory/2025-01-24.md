## January 24, 2025 - MetaForge Pro Comprehensive Fixes

Today I completed a comprehensive set of fixes for the MetaForge Pro application, addressing all identified issues across multiple categories:

### Small Issues Resolved:
- Enhanced logging strategy with development-only logging
- Removed excessive console logs and replaced with proper logger
- Improved accessibility with ARIA labels in navigation

### Medium Issues Resolved:
- Created centralized configuration constants for magic numbers
- Applied constants throughout the application (MetaAlertFeed, deck export functions)
- Added reusable ErrorBoundary component

### Large Issues Resolved:
- Created environment validation utility to check required variables
- Fixed memory leaks in multiple components using useRef cleanup patterns
- Enhanced security by integrating environment validation with Supabase client
- Added comprehensive accessibility improvements to navigation

### Files Updated:
- Created: logger.ts, constants.ts, env-validator.ts, ErrorBoundary.tsx
- Modified: deckExport.ts, MetaAlertFeed.tsx, SideboardAdvisor.tsx, TheLab.tsx, DeckDissector.tsx, NotificationSettings.tsx, DeckExportMenu.tsx, client.ts, Navigation.tsx

The application now has improved reliability, security, performance, and accessibility while maintaining all existing functionality.
