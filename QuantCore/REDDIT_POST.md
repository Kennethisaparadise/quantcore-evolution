## Title

```
I built a 17-module self-compounding trading AI that evolves in real time and reads order books. Here's the code and how it works.

### The Problem

Most trading algorithms are **static** — they backtest well on historical data but crumble when markets shift. They're blind to microstructure, oblivious to regime changes, and incapable of evolving. I wanted something different.

### The Solution: QuantCore Evolution Engine

After 2+ years of development, I've built a **self-evolving, self-compounding trading intelligence** that combines genetic algorithms, regime detection, microstructure analysis, and real-time adaptation into a single organism.

It's not just a trading bot — it's a digital life form that **eats market data and evolves**.
